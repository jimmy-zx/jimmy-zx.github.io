## Depth-first search

### Colors
- White: unvisited
- Gray: encountered
- Black: explored

### Attributes
- `pi[v]`: the vertex from which `v` is encountered
- `s[v]`: start time, when the vertex is first encountered
- `f[v]`: finishing time, when all the vertex's neighbors have been visited

```python
def dfs_visit(G, u):
    G.color[u] = gray
    G.time += 1
    G.s[u] = time
    for v in G.neighbor(u):
        if G.color[v] == white:
            G.pi[v] = u
            dfs_visit(G, v)
    G.color[u] = black
    G.time += 1
    G.f[u] = time

def dfs(G):
    for v in G.V:
        G.color[v] = white
        G.f[v] = INF
        G.s[v] = INF
        G.pi[v] = None
    G.time = 0
    for v in G.V:
        if G.color[v] == white:
            dfs_visit(G, v)
```

### Runtime

(Assuming using adjancency list)

- Visit each vertex once `O(|V|)`
- Visit the neighbor of each vertex. Each edge is checked once `O(|E|)`

Total: `O(|V| + |E|)`

### Cycle detection

Denote `I[v] = [s[v], f[v]]`. For `u, v ∈ V`, either
`I[v] ⊆ I[u]` or `I[v] ∩ I[u] = None`.

`I[v] ⊆ I[u]` IFF `u` is an ancestor of `v` in the DFS forest.

- *Tree edge* an edge in the DFS-forest
- *Back edge* a non-tree edge pointing from a vertex to its ancestor
- *Forward edge* a non-tree edge pointing from a vertex to its descendant
- *Cross edge* all other edges

A directed graph contains a *cycle* IFF DFS yields a *back edge*

#### Undirected graph

Every edge is either a tree edge or a back edge.

Cannot have a forward edge as this edge should be already marked as back edge.
See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19886504/forward-edge-in-an-undirected-graph).

### Topological sort

Place the vertices in an order such that all edges are pointing to the right side.

1. Perform DFS
2. Order vertices in order of decreasing finishing times `f[v]`

### Strongly connected components

Subgraphs with strong connectivity (any pair of vertices can reach each other)

1. Perform DFS on `G`
2. Order vertices in the reverse order of `f[v]`
3. Computer `G^rev`
4. Perform DFS on `G^rev`, visiting vertices using order from step 2.
5. Each tree in DFS forest is SCC.
