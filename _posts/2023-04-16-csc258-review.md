## Transistors

### Semiconductors

*Semiconductor*:
Sillicon, Germanium. stable at room temperature,
allowing a small current.

*Impurities*:
n-type: group 15 (Phosphrous), p-type: group 13 (Boron).

*Doping*:
adding impurities to semiconductors.

n-type semiconductor has extra electron, while p-type semiconductor has holes.

When bringing p-type and n-type together, the electrons will mix with the holes,
creating a *depletion layer* (diffusion), and corresponding electric field (drift).
These two currents reach equilibrium.

*Forward bias*: (the arrow represents direction of electron)
```
+ | p-type | n-type | -
       < diffusion
       drift >
       < bias
```

Narrows the depletion layer and increase diffusion rate, short circuit.

*Reverse bias*: the contrary of forward bias, open circuit.

### Transistors

*MOSFET*: Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor

#### n-channel MOSFET

```
               G
           +-------+
           | Metal |
           +-------+
      S    | Oxide |     D
+--+-----+-+-------+-+-----+--+
|  |  N  |     P     |  N  |  |
|  +-----+           +-----+  |
+-----------------------------+ < substrate
```

`V_BS`: Substrate bias

- `S`: Source
- `D`: Drain
- `G`: Gate

At rest, at least one reverse bias is created. Therefore, no current.

If a voltage is applied on the gate, a layer of negative charge (in the reverse-bias
region of P-type) will be attracted
to the surface of p-type material, creating a *n-channel*.

| V\_DS | V\_GS | V\_DS |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 0     | 1     | 0     |
| 1     | 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     | 0     |

#### p-channel MOSFET

Same as n-channel, except that N and P are exchanged, and a logic zero voltage
is applied on the gate.

### Gates

Not connecting the output to high voltage is not the same as connecting it
to low voltage.

Data: `V_cc=5V`, `GND=0V`, switching time 120picosecond, switching interval 10ns.

NAND is the most common logic gate.

```
               V_cc
                 |
         +----------------+
         | Positive logic |
Input -> +----------------+ -> Output
         | Negative logic |
         +----------------+
                 |
                GND
```

Positive logic connects IFF Input leads to high Output.

Negative logic connects IFF Input leads to low Output.

Should be disjoint and cover every case.

## Circuit Creation

### Minterm and Maxterm

- `minterm` an AND expression with *every input present* in true or complemented form.

`m_x = AB(~C)D`:
Every output is low, except when A=1, B=1, C=0, D=1. (x is the row in truth table.)

- `maxterm` an OR expression with every input present in true or complemented form.

`M_x = A+B+~C+D`
Every output is high, except when A=0, B=0, C=1, D=0.

### Combining the Terms

- `SOM`: Sum-of-Minterms (union of high outputs)
- `POM`: Product-of-Maxterms (intersection of high outputs)

### Reducing Circuits

#### Gate cost

- `G`: number of gates.
- `GN`: number of gates, with NOT gates included.

#### Karnaugh maps

Grid of minterms (maxterms), arranged so that adjancent minterms (maxterms)
differ by a single literal IFF.

Note: the 2d grid wraps around. ie, the left most column is adjancent to the
right most column.

Don't care values: can be *either* 0 or 1.

## Two's Complement

- One's complement: `~x`. (`x + ~x = -1`)
- Two's complement: `~x + 1`.

Range:
- Unsigned: 0 ~ 2^n - 1
- Signed: -2^(n - 1) ~ 2^(n - 1) - 1

[//]: <> (lec05-flip_flop.md)
## Flip-flops

### Latches

- `~S~R` latch: Two interconnected NAND gates.
- `SR` latch: Two interconnected NOR gates.

`S`: Set, `R`: Reset, `~S~R`: Keep, `SR`: Forbidden.

### Clock signals

- Latency of transistors: setup and hold time.
- Setup time for clock signal.

### Clocked latches

- Clocked SR latch: two nand gates connected with `~S~R` latch, with
`~S = ~(SC)` and `~R = ~(RC)`.

Only allows S and R signals to affect the state when C is high.

- D latch: Clocked SR latch, with `S = D`, `C = ~D`.

Prevents forbidden space, but is transparent: any change to D when C is high
is visible immediately.

- SR master-slave flip-flop: two clocked SR latch, with a not gate on the clock of the second one.

A *flip-flop* is a latched circuit whose output is triggered with the edge of a clock pulse.

- Edge-triggered D flip-flop: connect D latch to the input of a clocked SR latch,
with a not gate on the clock of the clocked SR latch.

*Negative-edge triggered* changes value when clock goes down.

- T flip-flop: toggles the value with T goes high.

- JK flip-flop: `~J~K` maintain, `(~J)K` reset, `J(~K)` set, `JK` toggle.

### Timing

Input should NOT be changing at the same time as the active edge.

- Setup time: Input should be stable before the active edge.
- Hold time: Input should be stable after the active edge.

Time period between two active edges cannot be shorter than
the *longest propogation delay* and *setup time*.

### Reset
- Synchronous reset: the output is resetted only on the active edge.
- Asynchronous reset: the output is resetted immediately.

## Sequential Circuit

```

Input -> Combinational Circuit -> Output
         ^                   |
         +- Storage Units <--+
```

### Gate delay

(Propogation Delay)
The length of time for an input change to result in output change.

### Feedback circuits

- `and` and `or` will lock.
- `nand` and `nor` will oscillate.

## ALU

### ALU flags

- C: Carry
- Z: Zero
- N: Negative
- V: Overflow

### Multiplication

- Booth's Algorithm

If [i:i-1] = "01", the multiplicand is added at position i.

If [i:i-1] = "10", the multiplicand is subtracted from position i.

```python
def booth(a: Integer, b: Integer) -> Integer:
    assert len(a) == len(b)
    N = len(a) * 2
    a = a.extend(N)
    b = b.extend(N)
    print(a, b)
    cur = Integer(N)
    for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
        if b.content[i] == 0 and b.content[i - 1] == 1:
            nxt = a.sll(i)
        elif b.content[i] == 1 and b.content[i - 1] == 0:
            nxt = (-a).sll(i)
        else:
            continue
        print(f" {cur}\n+{nxt}\n={cur + nxt} ({i})\n")
        cur += nxt
    return cur
```

## Memory

```

- WC: Write Cycle Time.
- SA: Address Setup Time, time needed for address to be stable before enabling write.
- HA: Address Hold Time, time needed for address to be stable after enabling write.
- WP: Write Pulse Width
- SD: Data Setup Time (to Write End), time for data-in value to be setup at destination.
- HD: Data Hold Time (from Write End), time for data-in value should stay unchanged after write signal changes.

### General
- Address need time to setup
- Be conservative about timing

## MIPS Instructions

### Arithmetic instructions

- I-type: `IMM` is sign extended.
- `div?`: `lo = $rs / $rt`, `hi = $rs % $rt`.
- `mult?`: `hi:lo = $s * $t`.
- `(add|sub)?u`: same as `(add|sub)?`, but does not trap on overflow.
- `(mult|div)u` behaves differently from `(mult|div)`.

### Logical instructions

- I-type: `IMM` is zero extended.

### Shift instructions

- `sll*` operations will always sign extend into a 64-bit register, then
truncates the value into 32 bits.

### Jump instructions

- `j`: according to slides, `pc = (pc & 0xF0000000) | (IMM << 2)`, which is
different from the specification.

- The range of `j` is 256 MBytes.

### Branch instructions

- The offset is `i = (label - (next PC)) >> 2`. This is different from the slides.

- The range `b*` is +/- 128 KBytes.

### Comparison instructions
