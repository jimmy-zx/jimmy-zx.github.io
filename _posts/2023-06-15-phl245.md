# Arguments

An *argument* has one or more *premises* and one *conclusion*.

Denoted by
$$P_1, P_2, \ldots \therefore C$$.

## Statements

Premises and conclusions must be *statements*: sentences that are
true/false.

## Validity

An argument is *valid* if and only if there is no possibility where
the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

## Soundness

An argument is *sound* if and only if it is valid and all its premises
are true.

# Propositional logic

## Form

Validity is a matter of form. Any argument of the same form is valid.
