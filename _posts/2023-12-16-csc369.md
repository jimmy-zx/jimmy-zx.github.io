## Paging

### Page buffering

Page replacement policy is costly.

- Maintain a pool of free page
- Run replacement algorithm when pool is too small

### Thrashing

The case where OS pages data back and forth.

The system is overcommitted/oversubscribed.

- Swapping: write out all pages of a process and suspend it
- Out-of-memory watchdog
- More memory

### CPU utilization

Heavy IO implies low utilization. If page fault is frequent, not a good
idea to increase multiprogramming.

### Page tables

Put table in physical memory: easy to address.

Put table in VM: cold page table can be aged out, but page table itself requires
translation. Thus, do not page outer page table. Need to wire special
code and data.

### Managing swap

Use raw disk or file.

When to allocate/free swap.

### Advanced paging

- Share memory: share data, could be same or different vaddr.
- Copy-on-Write: defer copy as long as possible. Example: fork.
- Memory mapped files: all pages are invalid, and OS transforms memory access to file access.

## File systems

Longterm storage, that provides:
- Large storage
- Persistent
- Concurrent access

Requirements:
- Store data
- Keep track of free space
- Keep track of metadata

### Files

- Create
- Write
- Read
- Seek
- Delete
- Truncate

General purpose access:
- Sequential
- Direct

Database access:
- Record
- Index

### Directory

Hierarchy of directory `/usr/local/`

- Search entry
- Create entry
- Delete entry
- List
- Update

### Linkds

- Hard link: second directory entry identical to the first
- Symbolic link: file that holds the path to linked file

### Layout

Allocate blocks for file:
- Contiguous
- Chained
- Indexed (direct, single indirect, double indirect, triple indirect)

### Very Simple File System

Structure

- Superblock
- Inode bitmap
- Block bitmap
- Inode table
- Data blocks

Inode:

- Metadata
- Attributes
- Block locations

Inode to data:

- Direct blocks
- Indirect blocks
- Double indirect blocks

Directory:

- List of (name, inode) mappings

Hard links: multiple directory entries to same inode

Soft link: data contains path to target

### Improvements

Block groups: related files and directories are closed together.

# L11

## Redundancy

### RAID

Redundant array of independent disks.

- RAID0: Striping
- RAID1: Mirror each disk
- RAID5: Store pairity on one additional disk

## FFS

Files laid out with spatial locality in mind. Read performs well,
writes are not well-clustered.

But reads are cached in memory.

## LFS

Treat storage as a circular log.

- Write throughput improved.
- Cache recovery is simpler.

Inodes are scattered over all the disk.

Inode map to find inodes. FS must have some fixed and known location on disk
to begin lookup.

TODO:

- Crash recovery
- Garbage collection

## VFS Concept

Abstraction of file and collections, seperate from implementations.

```
read <-> sys_read <-> vfs_read <-> [file system]_read
```

## SSD

Page: unit of read/program (write).

Block: unit of earse.

Multiple channels so data can be striped across blocks (like RAID5).

Wear leveling:
- Always write to new location
- Map logical FS block to physical block
- Old versions are marked stale

Garbage collection:
- Reclaim stale pages by erase.

### Flash Translation Layer

- Translate logical blocks into physical blocks.
- Reduce extra copying to deal with erases.
- Implement wear leveling.

## FS goals

- Translate file name info number
- Sequential and random access
- Small/large files
- Metadata
- Crash recovery
- Free space
- Locality

## Modern file systems

ZFS: Pooled storage, integrity, performance.

BTRFS: Copy-on-write

### ZFS

RAID-Z1: 2+ disk for storage and 1 for parity. Dynamic stripe width.

Integrity: use checksum

#### Write caching

ZFS Intent Log (ZIL) on SLOG: writes are sent to ZIL, then flushed to long-term storage.

SLOG device: SSD / flash.

#### Read caching

- Multiple layers
- ARC

### BTRFS

Blocks with active data are reallocated instead of overwritten.

- Allows snapshots: image of entire data, can be restored. (No extra overhead.)

Space efficient: all unchanged data is shared.

Clones: writable snapshots.

- Disk blocks managed in extents, less fragmentation.

- Changes accumulated in memory and written back. Superblock is modified to point
to the new checkpoint.

- Needs defragmentation.

- Good concurrency: traverse using read lock. If write lock is needed, COW the block.

- Multiple device support.

#### Trees

- Subvolumn: user-visible files and dirs
- Extent: tracks allocated extent items (free-space map)
- Checksum: One checksum item per allocated extent

Snapshot is just a new subvolume that shares data with other subvolumes.

## Non-deadlock bugs

- Atomicity violation bugs (`++` and `--`)
- Order violation bugs (wrong order assumptions)

## Deadlocks

Mutal blocking of a set of threads.

- Communication deadlocks
- Resource deadlocks

### Deadlock prevention

#### Necessary conditions

1. Mutal exclusion

Only one process may use a resource at a time.

Prevention: use lock-free operations
```c
int CAS(int *addr, int expected, int new);

void AtomicAdd(int *val, int a) {
    do {
        int old = *val;
    } while (CAS(val, old, old + a) == 0);
}
```


2. Hold-and-wait

A process may hold allocated resource while awaiting assignment of others.

Prevention:
- Either process gets all resource, or none of them. (Long wait, might not know
resources a priori.)
- `trylock()` (Might result in livelock.)

3. No preemption

No resource can be forcibly removed from a process holding it.

Prevention:

Allow forcibly remove of resource, might require rollback

#### Sufficient conditions

4. Circular wait

A closed chain of processes exists, such that each process holds
some resources needed by the next process.

Prevention:

Ensure total / partial order

### Deadlock avoidance

Allows first three conditions, but ensures circular wait cannot occur.

1. Do not start a process if total resources required exceeds resources available.
2. Do not grant individual resource request if future paths results in deadlock.

#### Restrictions

1. Maximum resource requirements must be known a priori.
2. Process must be independent.
3. There must be a fixed number of resources.

#### Banker's algorithm

Each thread states its maximum resource requirements, acquires and releases
resources incrementally.

Runtime system delays granting some requests to ensure the system never deadlocks.

For every request:

1. Check if the resource can be granted.
2. Assume request is granted, check if the new state is safe.

A state is safe if there exists some sequence which every request is
successful.

### Deadlock detection

Trigger:

1. On every allocation request
2. Fixed period
3. System utilization drops below a threshold

Using a resource allocation graph:

- Nodes are processes and resources
- Arcs from resource to process represent allocations
- Arcs from process to resource represent ungranted requests

Note: not valid when there are multiple instances of same resource.

### Deadlock recovery

- Kill all deadlocked processes
- Back up and restart
- Selectively kill process
- Selectively preempt 

#### Ostrich Algorithm

Ignore the problem and hope that it doesn't happen often.

- Modern O/S virtualizes physical resources.
- Only dead lock on logical resources.

### Communication deadlocks

Example: packet loss

Solution: timeout, resend, protocol

## Transaction and Atomicity

### Transaction

A collection of operations that performs a single logical function.

Either commit (successful, cannot be undone), or abort (rollbacked).

Logs are time-consuming and large. Use checkpoints instead.

### Concurrent tranactions

- All transactions are protected with a mutex.
- Allow overlap operations, as long as they don't conflict.

Conflict if writes to the same data. Order does not matter.

#### Two-phase locking

Each data has their own locks.

Each transaction has growing (acquire only) and shrinking (release only) phase.

Use abort and retry if any lock is unavailable.

#### Timestamp

Each transaction gets unique timestamp, and each data has two timestamp:

- Largest timestamp of transactions that reads.
- Largest timestamp of transactions that writes.

Read: if tranaction's timestamp is earlier than last write, then needs to restart.

Write: if transaction's timestamp is earlier than last access, then needs to restart.

## File buffer cache

Programs exhibit locality for read/write. Cache file blocks in memory.

- Static partitioning: allocate fixed-size cache
- Dynamic partitioning: integrite VM pages and FS pages into unified page cache.

Use a buffer to buffer writes.

- Combine multiple writes
- Lazy updates
- Reduce writes

Speed vs durability

- Crash: buffered writes not written
- Durability: sync to disk more frequently

Mitigation

- Delay writes with specific amount of time
- Write-behind (maintain a queue)
- NVRAM (battery backed-up RAM)
- Log-structured file system

Read-ahead

- Predicts next request (prefetching).

## Magnetic disk

Disk, cylinder, track, sector.

- Seek: move disk arm to correct cylinder
- Rotation: wait for sector to rotate under head
- Transfer: actual data transfer

### Hardware optimization

- Track skew: arms move slowly, may miss the next sector outside. Thus skew the
track location.
- Outer tracks are larger by geometry, so hold more sectors.
- Cache: aware of disk geometry, cache the whole track.

### OS

- Program - File path, offset
- File system - Partition, block
- IO controller: Disk, sector
- Disk: Cylinder, track, sector

SCSI: high-level interface.

### File system

- Allocation algorithm
- Request scheduling

Goals:
- Closeness: reduce seek time
- Amortization: amortize delay

Fragmentation result in more seeking.

Traverse between data block and meta block.

#### FFS

Disk partitioned into group of cylinders.

- Data blocks in the same file is in the same group.
- Files in same dir is in the same group.
- Inode is in the same group as blocks.

Free space requirement
- Disk must have free space scattered across sylinders.
- For large files, break into chunks.
- Allocate from a nearby group if preferred group is full.

#### Disk scheduling

- First Come First Serve: No reording
- Shortest Seek Time First: Minimizes arm movement, maximize request rate
- Scan: Service request in one direction
- C-Scan: Scan but only one direction
- Look/C-Look: Like Scan but only go as far as last request

## Reliability

fsck - check consistency of filesystem (only metadata)

1. Superblock
2. Free blocks
3. Inode state
4. Inode links
5. Duplicates
6. Bad blocks
7. Directory checks

Very slow

### Journaling

Writes to journal first, then writes to actual position. (ext3)

Transaction:
1. TxBegin
2. Updated inode
3. Updated bitmap
4. Updated data
5. TxEnd

Note: TxEnd must be written after all data.

Logs can be discarded after committed. Use circular log.

Full journaling requires at least double writes. Journal metadata instead.

1. Write data
2. Metadata journal write
3. Metadata journal commit
